##### 1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
1. Is a way to assigned operator in a shorter  syntax. It is performed on the two operands before the result is assigned to the first operands.
---
##### 2. List all the compound assignment operators.
2. += addition assignment, -= Subtraction, * = multiplication, /= division, %= remainder, &= AND assignment, |+ OR, ^= XOR.
---
##### 3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
3. Preincrement ++(++a) and PostIncrement ++(a++). Predecrement -- (--a) and Postdecrement -- (a--).
---
##### 4. How long does a while loop run?
4. It keeps running until the while statement becomes false.
---
##### 5. What is an iteration variable? (Not in book)
5. A process where a set of instructions or statement is executed repeatedly for a specified number of time or until conditions are met.
---
##### 6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
6. The while statement will continue forever. Once must add an increment/decrement value or a break statement.
---
##### 7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?
7. It has three, the init, condition and the increment. yes you can omit the first but you must still use the semi-column to split the parts. The statement will run forever.
---
##### 8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
8. Once must use the do-while statement which runs at least once.
---
##### 9. What does the break statement do?
9. The break statement terminates the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code.
---
##### 10. What does the continue statement do?
10. The continue statement is similar to the break statement but instead of terminating the loop entirely, it skips the current iteration fo the loop and continues with the next iteration.
---
##### 11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An “infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
11. If one wants to output an continues output of number that keeps adding/subtracting. This would be ideal but most cases there is no reason to do so.
