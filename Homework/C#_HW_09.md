##### 1.What is an enum?
1. Is a value type data type. The enum is used to declare a list of named integer constants. A symbolic constant.
---
##### 2.Declare an enum for military ranks, either officer or enlisted. Name it Ranks. What are the symbols, like Private, Corporal, Sergeant or Lieutenant, Captain, Major?
2. Enum Ranks{
  Private = 1,
  Corporal = 2,
  Sergeant = 3,
  Lieutenant = 4
  Captain = 5,
}
--
##### 3.Using the Ranks enum, assign a rank to yourself and a friend
3. Console.WriteLine(Ranks.Sergeant);
---
##### 4.Determine the numeric index of particular ranks, using the Ranks enum
4. Console.WriteLine((int)Rank.Sergeant);
---
##### 5.How do you select the type of an enum?
5. enum is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type.
---
##### 6.What is a struct?
6. A struct is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types.
---
##### 7.List some differences between classes and structs
7. Struct cannot have a default constructor, Struct are value types and are copied on assignment. A struct cannot inherit directly from another class or strut.
---
##### 8.Are structs stored on the stack or on the heap? What about enums?
8. No structs and enums(its a value type) are allocated on the stack.
---
##### 9.Review the documentation for the C# System.Int32 struct. List the fields. List the methods.
9. Fields-MaxValue and MinValue, Methods-CompareTo, Equals, Parse, TryParse.
---
##### 10.Declare a struct named DOD with four branches.
10. Enum DOD{
  Army = 1,
  Marine = 2,
  Namy = 3,
  AirForce = 4,
}
---
##### 11.Why canâ€™t you create a default constructor for a struct?
11. Because for a value type, compilers by defaults neither generate a default constructor, nor do they generate a call to the default constructor.
---
##### 12.What is CIL? What does the CLR do to the CIL?
12.Common Intermediate Language is a ByteCode and the Language of the .NET platform into which are compiled source code written in high level language.  Role of CLR(Command Language Runtime) in the execution of a C# program.
