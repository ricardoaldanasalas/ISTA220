###  C# HW02

1. 1. Its a type of variable declared by local variable declaration at the 
     beginnning of a block the variable is intended to be local to. 
1. 2. A **statement** is the action of a program.
1. 3. Identifiers are used for indentification purposes. It is a user-defined
      name of the program components.
1. 4. A **variable** is a name given to a storage area that is used to stored
      values of various data types.
1. 5. A **method** is a code block that contains a series of statements. It is 
      the entry porint for every C# application and called bye the common language
      runtime(CLR)
1. 6. A **primitive** type is a type defined at the programming language level,
      often it is a even a value type, directly supported by the compiler of the language.
      A valuetyep is usually whatever type reside on the stack.]
1. 7. you can use all the type char, int, long ... like the variables.
1. 8. One would att the syntex .ToString() at the end of the variable.
1. 9. You can convert it by using the methods System.convert classs or by calling the Parse or 
      TryParse method. Exam. var number = int.Parse("11")
1. 10.Operator precedence determines which operator is performed first in an expression with 
      more than one operators with different precedence. Operators Associativity is used when
      two operators of same precedence appear in an expression.
1. 11. is a rule simply stating that every variable must have a value before it's read from.
1. 12. The prefix decrement increases the value of its operand before  it has been evaluated.
       The prefix increment/decrement change the value before the expresssion is evaluated.
       The postfix incre/decrement change the value ofter.
1. 13. Is used to format and manipulate string. is a method of concatenating, formatting and
       manipulating strings.//$ before a string so that a variable will be use in the string.
