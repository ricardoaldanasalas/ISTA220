##### 1. Give five examples (using valid C# code) of the five bitwise operators listed in the text
1.  c = a & b, c = a | b, c = a ^ b, c = ~a, c = a << b, c = a >> b
---
##### 2. . Does C# implement the right-shift (>>) operator? If so, give an example of its operation using valie C# code
2. yes. a = a<<b
--
##### 3. Explain in detail this code: bits & (1 << index);.
3. One will shift to the left and will equal
---
##### 4. Explain in detail this code: bits |= (1 << index);.
4. bit is the same or equal to index shift to the left. Evaluates the index and shift it to the left were it will equal to bits.
---
##### 5. Explain in detail this code: bits &= (1 << index);.
5. bits i sthe smae as index miinus 1. Truth if you have two true false other wise. returns a true or a false.
---
##### 6.How does C# interpret this? bool peek = bits[n];
6.if bits n is true retrun
---
##### 7.How does C# interpret this? bits[n] = true;
7.if bits n is 1 it is true. It turns the n number into true.
---
##### 8.How does C# interpret this? bits[n] ^= true;
8. The result of bits is the same as one it is true.
---
##### 9.Assume that users were assigned read, write, and execute permissions according to this scheme: read = 1, write = 2, execute = 4. How would you interpret the following user permissions:
9.
---
##### 10 Answer the previous question by converting the decimal permissions into binary permissions. What does this tell you about using this shceme of permissions?
10.
